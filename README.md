# EvolutionAlgorithm Project README

## Project Description

The "EvolutionAlgorithm" is a project written in .NET6, which implements simulations of a generic algorithm that solves the problem of the best arrangement of machines on a board given in a parameter (e.g. 5 x 6), between which there is a flow of a given cost.
The input data is given in the folder ./Input
Population learning is done by applying mutation operators and population selection. Details of the learning process and its results are described in the file "Algorytm ewolucyjny - wyniki - Miko≈Çaj Macioszczyk.pdf"

## Requirements

1. .NET 6 platform installed
